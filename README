jQuery Simple Metadata Plugin

By Jared Grippe

Inspired by John Resig's Metadata http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Metadata

This plugin is capable of silently, and automatically, importing metadata 
from an element's data attribute the first time you use the jQuery data store

For example, you can do:
<li id="thing" data="{some:'random', json: 'data'}">...</li>
jQuery('#thing').data('some') == 'random';

Aside from being a lot simpler and a heck of a lot less code I like having all 
of the meta data about an element in one place. Just throw some JSON in inline
and get it from .data() // Simple
